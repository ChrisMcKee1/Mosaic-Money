# Mosaic Money Scoped Instructions

This folder contains file-scoped custom instruction files (`*.instructions.md`).

## Usage model
- These instructions are applied by VS Code based on each file's `applyTo` glob.
- They complement, but do not replace, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

## Current instruction set
- `mosaic-money-dotnet-api.instructions.md`
- `mosaic-money-nextjs-frontend.instructions.md`
- `mosaic-money-typescript.instructions.md`
- `mosaic-money-security.instructions.md`
- `mosaic-money-doc-sync.instructions.md`

## Source and curation
- Derived from relevant concepts in `github/awesome-copilot` instruction files.
- Rewritten to conform to Mosaic Money PRD and architecture constraints.
