# PRD Workflow

Use this skill before planning or delegating major feature work.

## Required process
1. Restate the user problem and intended outcome.
2. Define measurable acceptance criteria.
3. Capture non-goals and constraints.
4. Split work into backend, frontend, mobile, AI, and DevOps slices as applicable.
5. Add verification criteria for each slice.

## Mosaic Money planning constraints
- Respect single-entry accounting model.
- Preserve human-in-the-loop for ambiguous financial actions.
- Keep projection-only UI features separate from ledger source of truth.
- Enforce Aspire-native integration and reference-driven orchestration.
