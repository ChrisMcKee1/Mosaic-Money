# Partner Triage Credential Notes (Template)

Copy this file to `partner-triage.credentials.local.md` for local-only notes.

Suggested local setup:

1. `Copy-Item triage-partners.env.example triage-partners.env.local`
2. Populate `triage-partners.env.local` with Partner A/B test credentials.
3. (Optional) `Copy-Item partner-triage.credentials.example.md partner-triage.credentials.local.md`
4. Store only operational hints in the local markdown file, never raw credentials in source-controlled files.
